1a) The greedy algorithm you could use is to take as many coins of the largest denomination possible first. You lower to the next demoniation after you can't use a denomination. 
1b)
1c) The algorithm and span is O(logN).

2a) One counterexample is assume Fortuito has denominations [10, 6, 1]. If you go to Fortuito and need change for 12, the greedy algorithm designates that you receive 3 coins: 10, 1, and 1. However, the optimal solution in this case would be to ignore the largest value and take 2 coins of value 6.
2b) The optimal substructure property means that the optimal solution to a given problem can be divided into the optimal solution to sub-problems of the original problem.
2c) d is an array of denomination values, n is the amount of change to be made.
